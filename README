  ULib - C++ library

  ULib is normally built and installed as a set of shared object
  libraries and header files. These libraries and headers are installed
  using directories selected through a "configure" script that has been
  prepared with automake and autoconf. As such, they should build and
  install similarly to and in a manner compatible and consistent with most
  other GNU software.

  ULib is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
